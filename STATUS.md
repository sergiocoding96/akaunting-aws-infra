# Akaunting AWS Infrastructure Project Status

## What Has Been Achieved

- ✅ Created CloudFormation template for Akaunting deployment (single server architecture)
- ✅ Successfully deployed the infrastructure on AWS
- ✅ Configured EC2 instance with t2.micro (free tier compatible)
- ✅ Installed MariaDB directly on the EC2 instance (avoiding RDS compatibility issues)
- ✅ Configured security groups with proper access rules (ports 80, 443, 22)
- ✅ Implemented UserData script to automate Akaunting installation

## Current Status

- ✅ CloudFormation stack successfully created (StackStatus: CREATE_COMPLETE)
- ✅ EC2 instance is running (Status: running)
- ✅ Public IP assigned: 52.206.193.137
- ✅ Security groups properly configured with inbound rules
- ❌ Server not responding to HTTP requests (connection timeout)
- ❌ Unable to access via SSH (no key pair configured)
- ❌ Cannot use Systems Manager (SSM) due to permission limitations

## Identified Issues

1. The EC2 instance is running but not responding to HTTP requests
2. Cannot directly debug the issue as we lack SSH access (no key pair) and SSM permissions
3. The Apache web server might not be running or properly configured
4. The UserData script might have encountered errors during execution

## Next Steps

1. Terminate the current CloudFormation stack
2. Update the template to include an SSH key pair for direct access
3. Re-deploy the stack with the updated template
4. SSH into the instance to check logs and debug issues:
   - Verify Apache is running (`systemctl status httpd`)
   - Check installation logs (`cat /var/log/user-data.log`)
   - Examine Apache error logs (`cat /var/log/httpd/error_log`)
5. Fix any identified issues and ensure Akaunting is properly installed
6. Complete the Akaunting setup via web interface

## Commands for Next Steps

```bash
# 1. Terminate current stack
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name akaunting-production

# 2. Update template locally to include key pair (already created)

# 3. Re-deploy with updated template
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name akaunting-production \
  --template-body file://akaunting-combined.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=DBPassword,ParameterValue=AkauntingDB2024 \
               ParameterKey=EnvironmentType,ParameterValue=production \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```
